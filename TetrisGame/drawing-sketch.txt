A simple `PrintLayoutBox` class, the instances of which is feed to the `PrintHelper` methods. Because this class has a set width and height, and pre-defined rows, we side-step having to do width/height calculations as well as all of the string-to-array splitting.

PrintLayoutBox
// Width
// Height
// Rows
// ToString -> rows as a stirng separated by "\n". The final row does not end in "\n".

PrintLayoutBox stats = new PrintLayoutBox(
  "",
  "",
  ""
);

stats.width
